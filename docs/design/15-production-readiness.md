# Design 15: Production Readiness — Competitive Gap Analysis

> Created: 2026-04-20
> Status: Active — gap tracking
> Lens: "Would a platform team at a Series B company choose kardinal-promoter over Kargo
> in a competitive evaluation today?" Every 🔲 item below is a reason the answer is No.

This doc is maintained by the vibe-vision-auto scan. Engineers pick items from this
doc's Future section and open `kind/enhancement` issues to close them.

---

## Purpose

The standard design docs (01–14) track feature implementation. This doc tracks
**competitive gaps, production-stability defects, and adoption blockers** that have no
other home. The PDCA scenarios test what we have — they do not test what we are missing.

Every item in this doc was identified by examining the live codebase against five lenses:

1. **Kargo parity** — what Kargo does that kardinal cannot model at all
2. **Production stability** — what would a platform team find broken after a week in prod
3. **Observability** — can an operator understand a stalled Bundle without reading Go logs?
4. **Security posture** — would a security review at a Series B company pass this?
5. **Adoption** — what makes a platform engineer close the GitHub tab within 60 seconds?

---

## Present ✅

- ✅ **`kubectl get` printer columns on Bundle and PromotionStep CRDs** — Bundle now shows Type, Pipeline, Phase, Age. PromotionStep shows Pipeline, Env, Bundle, State, Age. Eliminates the need to `kubectl describe` to find which pipeline a step belongs to. (PR #903, 2026-04-20)
- ✅ **WaitingForMerge timeout** — `environment.waitForMergeTimeout` on Pipeline environments (e.g. `"24h"`) causes a PromotionStep stuck in `WaitingForMerge` to transition to `Failed` after the configured duration. No timeout by default (existing behavior preserved). Closes production-blocker: abandoned PR reviewers no longer stall pipelines indefinitely. (PR #906, 2026-04-20)
- ✅ **ScheduleClock minimum interval guard** — `pkg/reconciler/scheduleclock/reconciler.go` enforces `minInterval = 5 * time.Second` in `parseInterval()`. A zero or negative `spec.interval` is clamped to 5s, not looped at 0. (verified 2026-04-20; this item was incorrectly listed as Future)
- ✅ **SBOM attestation on the controller image** — `.github/workflows/release.yml` generates an SBOM with `anchore/sbom-action` (syft) and attaches it as a cosign attestation via `cosign attest`. SLSA Level 2 provenance also attached. (verified 2026-04-20; item was incorrectly listed as Future)
- ✅ **ValidatingAdmissionPolicy for Pipeline, Bundle, PolicyGate CRDs** — `chart/kardinal-promoter/templates/validating-admission-policy.yaml` validates required fields, updateStrategy enum, approval enum, and spec.expression at admission time. Requires Kubernetes 1.28+. Enabled by default; set `validatingAdmissionPolicy.enabled=false` for older clusters. Remaining gap: cycle detection in `dependsOn` (requires a webhook, not expressible in CEL VAP) — see Future item below. (verified 2026-04-20)
- ✅ **Bundle history GC — `historyLimit` enforced by bundle reconciler** (PR #910, 2026-04-20) — `Pipeline.spec.historyLimit` is now enforced in `pkg/reconciler/bundle/reconciler.go:enforceHistoryLimit`. On each new Bundle creation, terminal Bundles (Verified/Failed/Superseded) beyond the limit are deleted oldest-first. Default limit: 50. Kargo parity achieved.
- ✅ **Reconciler panic recovery — handled by controller-runtime default** (PR #920, 2026-04-20) — Verified against controller-runtime v0.23.3 source: `RecoverPanic` defaults to `true` in the controller-runtime internal controller package. A panic in any reconciler's `Reconcile()` increments `ReconcilePanics` metric, calls panic handlers, and returns a wrapped error for exponential backoff — no crash loop. DO NOT set `RecoverPanic: false` in `ctrl.Options{}`. See comment in `cmd/kardinal-controller/main.go`.
- ✅ **UI API Bearer token authentication** (PR #924, 2026-04-20) — `--ui-auth-token` flag (env: `KARDINAL_UI_TOKEN`) added to `cmd/kardinal-controller/main.go`. When set, all `/api/v1/ui/*` routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Static `/ui/*` assets bypass auth. Constant-time comparison via `crypto/subtle`. Warn-level log on startup when token is not set. Default is open (no token) for backwards compatibility. Tests in `cmd/kardinal-controller/ui_auth_test.go`. Remaining gaps: CORS lockdown (see Future items below).
- ✅ **TLS support for UI and webhook endpoints** (PR #937, 2026-04-20) — `--tls-cert-file` / `--tls-key-file` flags (env: `KARDINAL_TLS_CERT_FILE`, `KARDINAL_TLS_KEY_FILE`) added to both UI (`:8082`) and webhook (`:8083`) servers via `listenAndServeWithTLS()`. When both flags are set, `http.ListenAndServeTLS` is used; if neither is set, falls back to plain HTTP (backwards compatible). Helm chart exposes `controller.tlsCertFile` and `controller.tlsKeyFile` values for cert-manager or secret-mounted certificates. Remaining gap: CORS lockdown for cross-origin dashboard use (see Future items below).

---

## Future

### Lens 1: Kargo parity — capability gaps that lose competitive evaluations

- ✅ **NotificationHook CRD for outbound event notifications** (PR #914) — `NotificationHook` CRD added with `spec.webhook.url`, optional `spec.webhook.authorizationHeader`, `spec.events` (Bundle.Verified/Failed, PolicyGate.Blocked, PromotionStep.Failed), and optional `spec.pipelineSelector`. Reconciler watches Bundle, PolicyGate, and PromotionStep objects and fires HTTP POST webhooks at-most-once per event (idempotent via `status.lastEventKey`). JSON payload includes `event`, `pipeline`, `bundle`, `environment`, `message`, and `timestamp`. User docs at `docs/notifications.md` with Slack example.

- 🔲 **No ArgoCD-native image update step** — Kargo's `argocd-update` promotion step directly patches the ArgoCD Application's `spec.source.helm.valuesObject` or triggers a refresh without a git commit. This is the dominant Kargo use case for teams that store application config inside the ArgoCD Application rather than a GitOps repo. kardinal only supports git-write promotion (kustomize, helm values.yaml patch, config-merge). Teams using ArgoCD with inline image references cannot use kardinal without restructuring their ArgoCD setup. Adding an `argocd-set-image` step (patches `Application.spec` directly via the Kubernetes API) would unlock this cohort.

- 🔲 **No GitHub Actions native bundle creation** — Kargo has a GitHub Action (`akuity/kargo-action`) that creates Freight directly from a workflow step. kardinal requires `kardinal create bundle` or a `POST /api/v1/bundles` HTTP call, which requires the CI system to have network access to the in-cluster endpoint. Without an in-cluster ingress (which most teams don't set up initially), CI cannot create Bundles. A GitHub Action wrapper (`pnz1990/kardinal-action`) that wraps the HTTP call and handles ingress/port-forward discovery would remove this adoption blocker for GitHub Actions users.

- 🔲 **No UI for Bundle creation / triggering promotions** — Kargo has a UI button to manually trigger a promotion for testing. kardinal's UI is read-only for Bundle lifecycle (aside from pause/resume/rollback actions). A "Create Bundle" dialog in the UI (with image input + provenance fields) would let platform engineers test pipelines without CLI access. This is a table-stakes demo feature for a competitive evaluation.

- 🔲 **Warehouse-equivalent: no automatic discovery mode** — Kargo's Warehouse concept passively watches OCI registries and Git repos and creates Freight without CI pipeline integration. kardinal's `Subscription` CRD and `OCIWatcher`/`GitWatcher` are implemented (K-10), but there is no UI for managing Subscriptions and no `kardinal get subscriptions` CLI command. The capability exists but is invisible to users who don't read the API reference. Surface Subscription status in `kardinal get pipelines` and add a `kardinal get subscriptions` command.

### Lens 2: Production stability — what breaks after a week in production

- ✅ **Bundle reconciler orphan guard races with Pipeline deletion** — `pkg/reconciler/bundle/reconciler.go:134` handles the case where the parent Pipeline was deleted by self-deleting the Bundle. This is triggered by checking `isNotFound` on the Pipeline. If the Pipeline is being deleted (DeletionTimestamp set but finalizers not cleared), the check may transiently pass, causing premature Bundle deletion before the Pipeline's owned resources are cleaned up. Add a check for `pipeline.DeletionTimestamp != nil` and requeue instead of deleting. (PR #919)

- 🔲 **Git credential rotation with zero downtime** — kardinal reads the SCM token from a Kubernetes Secret at controller startup (or at first reconcile). If the Secret is rotated (new PAT issued, old PAT expired), the controller must be restarted to pick up the new token. This causes a gap in promotions during the restart window. The SCM factory should watch the Secret and reinitialize providers on change without a controller restart. Kargo handles credential rotation natively. This is a production-operations requirement for any team that rotates credentials on a schedule.

### Lens 3: Observability — can an operator understand a stall without Go logs?

- 🔲 **Missing Prometheus metrics for step duration and gate blocking time** — `pkg/reconciler/observability/metrics.go` exports 4 counters (bundles_total, steps_total, gate_evaluations_total, pr_duration_seconds). There is no metric for: (a) per-step execution duration (git-clone latency, kustomize latency), (b) PolicyGate blocking duration histogram (how long has this gate been blocking?), (c) PromotionStep age histogram (how old is the oldest in-flight step?), (d) reconciler queue depth. Without (b) and (c), a Grafana dashboard cannot answer "which gates are blocking prod right now and for how long?" — the most common on-call question.

- 🔲 **No `kardinal status` command for in-flight promotion details** — `kardinal get pipelines` shows environment states. `kardinal explain` shows gate details. Neither command answers "my prod promotion is stuck — what exactly is it waiting for right now?" A `kardinal status <pipeline> [--bundle <name>]` command should show: current state of every PromotionStep (with active step highlighted), which PolicyGates are blocking (with CEL expression + current variable values), which PRs are open and their review status. This is the first command a new user needs when something is wrong.

- 🔲 **`kardinal logs` surfaces static snapshot only — per-step granularity missing** — `cmd/kardinal/cmd/logs.go` shows `status.message`, `status.outputs`, `status.prURL`, and `status.conditions` from the PromotionStep. It does NOT show the individual `status.steps[]` entries (step name, start time, duration, stdout/stderr per step). If `kustomize` fails, the operator sees only the top-level `message` field, not which specific step failed or what the kustomize stderr was. Render `status.steps[]` in `kardinal logs` output: one row per step with name, state, duration, and message. This gives operators the same granularity as `kubectl describe` on the raw CRD, without the YAML noise.

### Lens 4: Security posture — what a Series B security review would flag

- 🔲 **No Kubernetes TokenReview-based auth for UI API** — The current `--ui-auth-token` flag (see Present) is a static shared secret. A more secure alternative for cluster-native deployments is `TokenReview` authentication: the UI server calls `authenticationv1.TokenReview` to validate the calling user's kubeconfig token and can then apply RBAC-style namespace isolation. Until this is added, a single leaked `KARDINAL_UI_TOKEN` grants access to all pipeline data across all namespaces. Tracked also in `docs/design/06-kardinal-ui.md`.

- 🔲 **No admission webhook for `dependsOn` cycle detection** — `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` (now shipped, see Present) covers required fields and enum values for Pipeline, Bundle, and PolicyGate. It cannot detect graph cycles: a Pipeline where `prod` depends on `uat` and `uat` depends on `prod` is accepted at admission and only fails at translator time. A traditional `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` (not VAP) is needed to detect cycles, since CEL cannot express graph traversal. Until the webhook is added, the translator must return a clear `InvalidSpec` status condition rather than a reconciler error log. Kargo detects cycles on `kubectl apply`.

- 🔲 **SCM token scopes are not validated at startup** — the GitHub token is read from the Secret but its scopes are never verified. A token with only `read:repo` scope will fail silently when the controller tries to open a PR (403 response surfaces hours later in a reconcile log). Add a startup preflight check (similar to `kardinal doctor`) that calls the SCM provider's "whoami" endpoint and logs a warning if required scopes are missing. This surfaces misconfiguration in minutes rather than hours.

### Lens 5: Adoption — what makes a platform engineer close the GitHub tab

- 🔲 **`helm install` to first Bundle in under 10 minutes is not achievable** — the quickstart requires: create a GitOps repo with Kustomize overlays, configure ArgoCD Applications, create a GitHub PAT with correct scopes, set up the git branch structure, then install kardinal. A new user with no existing GitOps repo cannot complete the quickstart in under 30 minutes. Add a `kardinal init` command that scaffolds the GitOps repo structure (creates `env/test`, `env/uat`, `env/prod` branches, adds a kustomization.yaml with a placeholder image) and a `--demo` mode for `helm install` that deploys the `kardinal-test-app` as a demo target automatically. The "time to first promotion" metric must be under 10 minutes on a fresh kind cluster.

- 🔲 **No `kardinal get subscriptions` CLI command** — `Subscription` CRD and watchers are shipped (K-10) but invisible from the CLI. `kardinal get pipelines` does not show whether a pipeline has an active Subscription. A user who installed the Subscription CRD cannot easily verify it is working without `kubectl get subscriptions`. Add `kardinal get subscriptions` with columns: name, pipeline, source type, last check time, last bundle created.

- 🔲 **No community presence** — zero GitHub Discussions, zero Discord/Slack, no Stack Overflow tag. Kargo has an active community in their GitHub Discussions and a Discord server. A platform engineer who hits a problem has no place to ask for help except filing a GitHub issue. The single biggest reason someone closes the GitHub tab within 60 seconds is the perception that the project is abandoned. Add a GitHub Discussions board with seeded topics (Getting Started, Show & Tell, Feature Requests, Q&A) as the minimum. The automated agent should monitor Discussions for support questions and respond.

- 🔲 **No ADOPTERS.md or case studies** — zero public deployers. Kargo lists production adopters in their README. Even a single "we use this in our CI pipeline for the test app" entry (written by the agent about its own PDCA validation) would signal active use. Create `ADOPTERS.md` with the PDCA validation as the first entry: "kardinal-promoter uses itself — the PDCA workflow runs promotions of `kardinal-test-app` through `kardinal-demo` on every 6-hour cycle."

- 🔲 **No `kardinal completion` works for all shells** — shell completion is listed as shipped (`#606`) but there is no test that verifies the completion script generates valid output for bash/zsh/fish. Add a CI test that runs `kardinal completion bash` and `kardinal completion zsh` and verifies the output is non-empty and contains expected command names. Without working completion, power users get frustrated immediately.

### Lens 6: New gaps identified by Kargo comparison scan (2026-04-20)

- 🔲 **Bundle `status.conditions` are declared but never populated** — `api/v1alpha1/bundle_types.go` declares `Status.Conditions []metav1.Condition` but `pkg/reconciler/bundle/reconciler.go` never calls `apimeta.SetStatusCondition`. `kubectl describe bundle <name>` shows `Conditions: <none>`. Operators and automation that use standard K8s condition watches (e.g. `kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready`) cannot use them. Contrast: `PromotionStep` does populate conditions. Populate `Ready`, `Promoting`, and `Failed` conditions on Bundle status. This is also required for GitOps controllers (Flux, ArgoCD) that gate on resource readiness.

- 🔲 **No namespace-scoped controller mode** — the Helm chart deploys a `ClusterRole` that grants kardinal read/write access to `kardinal.io` CRDs across all namespaces. In a multi-tenant cluster, a platform team that installs kardinal for one team inadvertently grants it visibility into all namespaces. Kargo offers both cluster-scoped and namespace-scoped install modes. Add a `controller.watchNamespace` Helm value (default `""` = cluster-wide) that, when set, limits the controller's cache and ClusterRole/Role binding to that namespace only. A security review at a company with shared clusters will block installation without this.

- 🔲 **Bitbucket and Azure DevOps SCM providers are absent** — kardinal supports GitHub, GitLab, and Forgejo. Kargo supports GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps (the latter via `azure-devops` provider). Azure DevOps is the dominant SCM at enterprise accounts in regulated industries. `pkg/scm/factory.go` returns an error for `"bitbucket"` input. Teams on Bitbucket or Azure DevOps cannot use kardinal at all. Add `pkg/scm/bitbucket.go` and `pkg/scm/azuredevops.go` providers. PR templates, webhook validation, and PR-open/wait-for-merge operations must be implemented for both.

- 🔲 **No reusable PromotionTemplate concept** — Kargo has reusable promotion step sequences via `PromotionTemplate` spec that can be referenced across Stages. In kardinal, every Pipeline.spec.environment must repeat the full promotion step list (git-clone, kustomize, git-commit, open-pr, wait-for-merge, health-check). For an organization with 50 pipelines, every step list change requires 50 Pipeline YAML edits. Add a `PromotionPolicy` CRD that encapsulates a named step sequence. Environments reference it via `spec.promotionPolicy: name`. The translator inlines the steps at graph-build time. This is an adoption blocker for large-scale platform teams.

- 🔲 **`kardinal init` generates Pipeline YAML but does not scaffold the GitOps repo** — `cmd/kardinal/cmd/init.go` generates a Pipeline CRD YAML interactively. It does not create the GitOps repository branch structure (`env/test`, `env/uat`, `env/prod`), does not write `kustomization.yaml` overlays, and has no `--demo` mode. The Future item in Lens 5 (time-to-first-Bundle under 10 min) depends on `kardinal init` doing the repo scaffold. The command exists but solves only 20% of the onboarding problem. A new user still needs to understand GitOps repo structure before they can create a working Pipeline.

### Lens 7: New gaps identified by competitive scan (2026-04-20)

- 🔲 **`RequeueAfter: time.Millisecond` in bundle reconciler is a production hot loop** — `pkg/reconciler/bundle/reconciler.go:358` requeues the Bundle immediately (`time.Millisecond`) after setting phase to `Available`, to "advance to Promoting". With dozens of concurrent Bundles, each one fires a reconcile within 1ms of phase change, creating a burst of reconcile events that pressures the API server and etcd. Replace with `RequeueAfter: 500*time.Millisecond` as the minimum safe floor. The controller-runtime workqueue will deduplicate simultaneous events, but 1ms bypass of normal rate limiting is not safe for production clusters with >10 concurrent pipelines. This will manifest as elevated API server CPU and etcd write throughput after ~2 hours in a busy cluster.

- 🔲 **No `maxConcurrentPromotions` cap per pipeline** — Kargo enforces `maxConcurrentPromotions` on a Stage, preventing runaway promotion storms (e.g. when a CI system creates 50 Bundles within seconds after a maintenance window). kardinal has no such field. The bundle reconciler will attempt to promote all available Bundles simultaneously. For large organizations with many pipelines, this can saturate git hosts with concurrent PR-open requests, exhaust GitHub API rate limits (5000 req/hr), and create merge conflicts in the GitOps repo. Add `Pipeline.spec.maxConcurrentPromotions` (default: 0 = unlimited, compatible with existing behavior) enforced in the bundle reconciler before creating the Graph.

- 🔲 **No image signature verification step** — Kargo v1.10 added a `verify-image` promotion step that runs `cosign verify` against the container image before it advances to the next stage. kardinal has no equivalent: any image digest (including a compromised or unauthorized one) will be promoted without verifying the publisher's signature. For a security-conscious platform team, this is a supply-chain control gap. Add a `verify-image` step type in `pkg/steps/steps/` that runs `cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer <issuer> --certificate-identity-regexp <regex> <image>` and fails the PromotionStep if the signature is absent or invalid. This is also a differentiator: both Kargo and kardinal can advertise cosign integration.

- 🔲 **No Kubernetes Events emitted by reconcilers** — reconcilers in `pkg/reconciler/` write audit records to a ConfigMap (`writeAuditEvent`) and update CRD status fields. They do NOT emit Kubernetes Events via `EventRecorder`. This means `kubectl describe bundle <name>` and `kubectl describe promotionstep <name>` show no event history — the most common operator debugging tool is silent. Add `EventRecorder` to each reconciler and emit `Normal`/`Warning` events on: Bundle phase transitions (Available→Promoting→Verified/Failed), PolicyGate first-block, PromotionStep state transitions (Executing→WaitingForMerge→Verified), and PromotionStep failure with the step name and error message. This surfaces all promotion activity in `kubectl get events -n kardinal-system` without requiring Go log access.

- 🔲 **No multi-tenant project isolation** — Kargo has a Project CRD that namespaces all Stages, Promotions, and Warehouses under a single owner entity, with RBAC scoped to the project. kardinal has no equivalent: all Pipelines and Bundles share the same namespace with the same ClusterRole. A platform team running kardinal for 20 application teams cannot grant Team A write access to their Pipeline without also granting them read access to Team B's pipelines and bundles. Until namespace-scoped controller mode is added (see Lens 6), document the recommended workaround: one kardinal install per application namespace. This workaround is costly (multiple controller replicas), but it is the only safe multi-tenant configuration today.

### Lens 8: New gaps identified by vision scan (2026-04-20)

- 🔲 **No per-step execution timeout** — `pkg/steps/steps/git_clone.go`, `kustomize.go`, and `helm_set_image.go` have no per-execution timeout. A `git clone` against a slow SCM host or a `kustomize build` on a large repo can block a PromotionStep's `Reconcile()` call indefinitely. With controller-runtime's default `MaxConcurrentReconciles=1` per resource type, a single hung step can stall ALL other PromotionSteps of that pipeline. Add a `Pipeline.spec.environments[].stepTimeoutSeconds` field (default: 300) propagated via `StepState.Config["stepTimeoutSeconds"]`. Each step executor must wrap its operation in `context.WithTimeout`. This is especially critical for `git-clone` where network hangs are common in restricted egress environments.

- 🔲 **`kardinal logs` has no `--follow` / streaming mode** — `cmd/kardinal/cmd/logs.go` renders a static snapshot of `PromotionStep.status.stepMessages` at the time of the call. There is no `--follow` flag to stream messages as steps execute. For a platform engineer watching an active `git-clone` → `open-pr` sequence, they must repeatedly run `kardinal logs <pipeline>` to see progress. Add a `--follow` flag that polls for status changes every 2s (or watches the resource) and streams new `stepMessages` entries as they are appended. This is the key observability feature a new user needs to trust that something is actually happening.

- 🔲 **`kardinal status <pipeline>` is not per-pipeline** — `cmd/kardinal/cmd/status.go` shows cluster-level controller health (version, pipeline count, bundle count). It does NOT show in-flight promotion details for a specific pipeline. A new user who runs `kardinal status nginx-demo` gets a cluster summary, not "what is nginx-demo doing right now?" Rename or extend `status` to accept a pipeline argument. When a pipeline name is provided, show: current PromotionStep states (with active step highlighted), blocking PolicyGates (with CEL expression + evaluated variable values), and open PR URLs. This is the single most impactful CLI change for new user time-to-understanding.

- ✅ **No CORS lockdown on UI API** — the UI API (`/api/v1/ui/*`) has no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header restriction. Any web page loaded in the same browser as the kubectl port-forward session can issue cross-origin requests to the UI API and read all pipeline/bundle/gate data. For a security-conscious operator who port-forwards the UI to localhost, this is a cross-origin data exfiltration risk. Add CORS middleware that: (a) restricts `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `localhost:*` and the configured external UI URL when `--cors-allow-origin` is set; (b) sets `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: false` (UI uses Bearer, not cookies); (c) allows only `GET`, `POST`, `OPTIONS` methods. This is a prerequisite for any future external dashboard deployment. Tracked in `docs/design/06-kardinal-ui.md`. (PR #940)

### Lens 9: New gaps identified by vision scan (2026-04-20, pressure lens pass 2)

- 🔲 **No Grafana dashboard shipped with the Helm chart** — `docs/aide/roadmap.md` claims "Grafana dashboard JSON in `config/monitoring/`" as a delivery in a completed milestone, but `config/monitoring/` does not exist. `docs/guides/monitoring.md` says "Dashboard ID: pending submission to grafana.com". A platform team that installs kardinal and opens their Grafana instance has nothing to import. `PrometheusRule` alerting rules are shipped (see chart template), but a dashboard JSON (bundle phase counts, step duration histograms, gate blocking time) is the operability artifact that makes Prometheus useful day-to-day. Ship a `config/monitoring/kardinal-promoter-dashboard.json` and a Helm chart ConfigMap template (`grafana.sidecar.dashboards.enabled=true` compatible) so Grafana auto-discovers it.

- 🔲 **`kardinal logs` does not render per-step `status.steps[]` entries** — `cmd/kardinal/cmd/logs.go` shows `status.message`, `status.outputs`, `status.prURL`, and `status.conditions`. The `status.steps[]` field (type `[]StepStatus`, populated by `initStepStatuses` in the reconciler) contains per-step name, state, start time, and message — but `logsFn` never iterates it. A platform engineer who runs `kardinal logs nginx-demo` cannot see which step (git-clone, kustomize, git-commit, open-pr) is currently executing or which step failed. Render `status.steps[]` as a table row per step with columns: step name, state, duration, message. This is the primary debugging surface for a failed promotion.

- 🔲 **`kardinal status <pipeline>` shows cluster summary, not per-pipeline detail** — `cmd/kardinal/cmd/status.go` shows controller version, pipeline count, and bundle count. When called with a pipeline name argument (`kardinal status nginx-demo`), it ignores the argument and shows the same cluster summary. A new user who sees something is wrong runs this command and gets no useful information. Add pipeline-name argument handling: when a pipeline name is provided, show the in-flight PromotionStep states (with active step highlighted), blocking PolicyGates (with CEL expression and current result), and open PR URLs. This is the highest-impact single CLI fix for new user onboarding and on-call debugging.

- 🔲 **No Grafana runbook URL in PrometheusRule alerts** — `chart/kardinal-promoter/templates/prometheusrule.yaml` defines alerts (e.g. `KardinalControllerDown`, `KardinalHighReconcileErrors`). The `runbook_url` annotations reference `https://pnz1990.github.io/kardinal-promoter/troubleshooting/#start-here-kardinal-doctor` which may not exist as a page. Add a `docs/troubleshooting.md` page with anchor `#start-here-kardinal-doctor` that explains the `kardinal doctor` command and common failure modes. A dead runbook URL in a production alert is a signal that the project is not production-ready.

- 🔲 **`kardinal completion` CI test is absent — completion scripts may silently break** — `cmd/kardinal/cmd/completion.go` implements shell completion. There is no test that verifies `kardinal completion bash` and `kardinal completion zsh` produce valid, non-empty output containing current command names. As new commands are added (e.g. `kardinal rollback`, `kardinal approve`), the completion script can silently exclude them if the cobra command tree is not wired correctly. Add a CI test in `cmd/kardinal/cmd/completion_test.go` that generates bash and zsh completion scripts and asserts: (a) output is non-empty, (b) output contains expected subcommand names (`get`, `explain`, `logs`, `status`, `rollback`, `approve`). This protects power users and scripting workflows.

## Triage notes

**Must-fix before v1.0 (any one of these is a production-blocker):**
1. ~~Bundle history GC (historyLimit)~~ ✅ Done (PR #910) — enforced in bundle reconciler
2. ~~PromotionStep timeout~~ ✅ Done (PR #906) — WaitingForMerge timeout added
3. ~~Reconciler panic recovery~~ ✅ Done (PR #920) — handled by controller-runtime v0.23.3 default (RecoverPanic=true)
4. ~~UI API authentication~~ ✅ Done (PR #924) — `--ui-auth-token` Bearer token auth implemented; upgrade to TokenReview is a Future item
5. ~~HTTP plain-text for UI and webhook servers~~ ✅ Done (PR #937) — TLS support added via `--tls-cert-file`/`--tls-key-file`; cert-manager compatible
6. Bundle `status.conditions` never populated — breaks `kubectl wait` and GitOps tooling
7. `RequeueAfter: time.Millisecond` hot loop in bundle reconciler — API server pressure in busy clusters
8. No per-step execution timeout — a hung `git-clone` stalls all PromotionStep reconciles for that pipeline

**Must-fix for competitive parity with Kargo:**
1. Outbound event notifications (Slack/webhook)
2. ArgoCD-native image update step
3. ~~`kubectl get` printer columns on Bundle/PromotionStep CRDs~~ ✅ Done (PR #903)
4. Bitbucket and Azure DevOps SCM providers — blocks enterprise adoption
5. Namespace-scoped controller mode — required for multi-tenant clusters
6. Image signature verification step (cosign verify) — supply-chain control gap vs Kargo v1.10
7. `maxConcurrentPromotions` cap per pipeline — prevents promotion storms from CI bursts
8. No Kubernetes Events emitted by reconcilers — `kubectl describe` is silent; operators cannot diagnose without Go logs

**Adoption wins (high effort/impact):**
1. `kardinal init` full GitOps repo scaffolding (currently generates Pipeline YAML only)
2. GitHub Actions wrapper action
3. GitHub Discussions community presence
4. Reusable PromotionTemplate CRD
5. `kardinal status <pipeline>` per-pipeline in-flight view — highest-impact new CLI command for new users
6. `kardinal logs --follow` streaming mode — new users need real-time feedback during first promotion
7. Grafana dashboard JSON shipped in Helm chart — makes Prometheus useful out-of-the-box
8. `kardinal logs` per-step `status.steps[]` rendering — primary debugging surface for failed promotions
