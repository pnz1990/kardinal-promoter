## [v0.6.0] — 2026-04-14

**Live-cluster validation infrastructure, J7 multi-tenant self-service, OCI/Git source watchers, pipeline deployment metrics**

### Added

- **Multi-tenant self-service (J7)** — ApplicationSet + Pipeline template bootstrap; team onboarding via Git directory; org PolicyGates automatically inherited (#489)
- **OCI + Git source watchers** — `OCIWatcher` and `GitWatcher` Subscription reconcilers poll registries and Git branches, creating Bundles on new images/commits (#491, #493)
- **Pipeline deployment metrics** — `Pipeline.status.deploymentMetrics` aggregated by `PipelineReconciler`: `rolloutsLast30Days`, `p50CommitToProdMinutes`, `p90CommitToProdMinutes`, `autoRollbackRate` (#498)
- **`changewindow.isAllowed()` / `changewindow.isBlocked()` CEL functions** — named-argument helpers for ChangeWindow gates (#506)
- **krocodile upgraded to `948ad6c`** — DNS-1123 node ID validation, drift timers (30 min), propagation hash includes `propagateWhen` state
- **Cardinal logo** — added across docs site, UI sidebar, and README

### Fixed

- `kardinal-promoter` controller image rebuilt correctly when Graph CR is deleted externally (#490)
- PDCA live-cluster validation workflow: fixed pipeline name mismatch, missing `platform-policies` namespace, missing controller install step (#514)
- CI: `enforce_admins: true` on branch protection; 8 required status checks; concurrency guards on Docs and E2E workflows (#513)

## [v0.7.0] — 2026-04-17

**WatchKind O(1) health checks, krocodile 81c5a03 upgrade, reactive PromotionStep reconciler, graph-first cleanup**

### Added

- **WatchKind health nodes** — `health.labelSelector` on Pipeline environments switches from Watch (O(n) full list per event) to WatchKind (O(1) incremental cache). Requires krocodile `745998f`+ (#652)
- **Kargo migration guide** — concept mapping, side-by-side Pipeline vs Kargo YAML, 7-step migration walkthrough in `docs/guides/` (#640)
- **Operations runbook expanded** — PolicyGate debugging, SCM failure modes, RBAC issues, krocodile restarts, performance tuning added (#639)
- **Bundle image diff in NodeDetail** — UI compares the current bundle's image against the previous bundle for that environment; closes a Kargo parity gap (#638)
- **Per-step progress observability** — `PromotionStep.status.steps[]` exposes each step with individual state, start time, and duration (#630)
- **`kardinal get pipelines --watch`** — real-time promotion progress with live table refresh (#629)
- **PrometheusRule CRD** — 6 pre-built alerting rules in Helm chart: promotion stuck, high rollback rate, policy gate blocked, SCM errors (#621)
- **UI: conditions summary and reason** — NodeDetail shows Kubernetes Conditions table with reason column; improved empty-state onboarding (#529, #530)
- **UI: Kubernetes events stream** — timestamped event history per PromotionStep in NodeDetail (#560)
- **UI: cross-environment error aggregation** — groups PromotionStep failures by type across environments; shows affected count (#564)
- **krocodile upgraded to `745998f`** — Decorator bootstrap primitive, Definition compile-time type inference, forEach array format support, DAG finalizer guard for non-resource nodes (#614)

### Fixed

- **Bundle reconciler watches Pipeline changes** — Graph is regenerated when Pipeline spec changes (new environments, updated policyNamespaces, changed git config). Previously Pipeline changes were invisible to in-flight Bundles (#634)
- **Subscription deduplication under HA** — uses label selector (`kardinal.io/source-digest`) instead of status field comparison; safe under concurrent reconciles and multiple controller replicas (#636)
- **CEL documentation accuracy** — corrected false claims about `pkg/cel/NewCELEnvironment()` (does not exist) and `schedule.*` (map variable, not CEL library function) in design docs and code comments (#631)
- **Shell completion** — bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell completion scripts via `kardinal completion <shell>` (#606)
- **`kardinal doctor`** — pre-flight cluster health check: validates CRD installation, krocodile, RBAC, and GitHub token before first use (#607)
- **Graceful shutdown** — controller drains in-flight reconcile loops on SIGTERM; no promotion steps interrupted by pod restarts (#605)
- **PodDisruptionBudget + topology spread** — minAvailable: 1 PDB and `topologySpreadConstraints` in Helm chart for HA deployments (#598)
- **krocodile bundled in Helm chart** — single `helm install` now installs both kardinal-promoter and the krocodile Graph controller; no separate `hack/install-krocodile.sh` step needed (#590)
- **Library-based git operations** — replaced `exec.Command("git")` with `go-git` library (`#517`). Controller no longer requires a `git` binary. Improves portability (distroless images) and performance.
- **K-07: Integration test step** — `integration-test` built-in step runs a Kubernetes Job inline during promotion; triggers `onFailure: abort | rollback` on failure
- **K-08: PR review gate** — `bundle.pr["staging"].isApproved` and `.approvalCount` in CEL context via PRStatus CRD; no external SCM API calls in the hot path
- **K-09: `kardinal override`** — emergency gate override with mandatory reason + time limit; audit record written to Bundle status and surfaced in PR evidence body
- **K-10: Cross-stage history CEL** — `upstream.<env>.soakMinutes`, `.recentSuccessCount`, `.recentFailureCount`, `.lastPromotedAt` in gate expressions
- **UI control plane** — all 7 UI issues shipped: fleet health dashboard (#467), pipeline ops view (#462), per-stage bake countdown (#463), in-UI actions (#464), release metrics bar (#465), bundle timeline (#466), policy gate detail (#468)
- **ScheduleClock CRD** — event-driven re-evaluation for `schedule.*` gates; eliminates polling-based recheck
- **Subscription CRD** — reconciler creates Bundles on artifact changes; OCI and Git source watchers are stub implementations (always return `Changed: false`) — see #491, #493
- **K-01: Contiguous bake timer** — `bake.minutes` + `bake.policy: reset-on-alarm`; bake timer resets on health alarm
- **K-02: Pre-deploy gates** — `when: pre-deploy` on PolicyGate; evaluated before `git-clone` starts
- **K-03: onHealthFailure policy** — `rollback | abort | none` per environment
- **K-04: ChangeWindow CRD** — blackout and recurring allowed-hours windows; `changewindow["name"]` in CEL
- **K-05: Bundle.status.metrics** — commitToFirstStageMinutes, commitToProductionMinutes, bakeResets, operatorInterventions; `kardinal metrics` CLI
- **K-06: Wave topology** — `wave: N` field; Wave N automatically depends on all Wave N-1 stages
- **ValidatingAdmissionPolicy** — Kubernetes admission webhook validates CEL expressions in PolicyGate at apply time

### Fixed

- Controller `/tmp` mount — `emptyDir` volume added for git-clone with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` (#609)
- `policy simulate` now searches all namespaces — org-level gates in `platform-policies` were never found
- `pkg/cel` standalone CEL evaluator eliminated — evaluation moved inline to PolicyGate reconciler
 - Rollback PR title and body now include rollback notice and the `kardinal/rollback` label

---

## [v0.5.0] — 2026-04-13

**Pipeline Expressiveness (K-Series), Enterprise UI Control Plane, krocodile upgrade**

### Added

- **K-01: Contiguous healthy soak** — `bake.minutes` + `bake.policy: reset-on-alarm` on environment spec; `BakeElapsedMinutes` and `BakeResets` tracked in PromotionStep status
- **K-02: Pre-deploy gate type** — `when: pre-deploy` on PolicyGate spec; blocks PromotionStep in `Waiting` state before `git-clone` starts
- **K-03: Auto-rollback with ABORT vs ROLLBACK distinction** — `onHealthFailure: rollback | abort | none` per environment
- **K-04: ChangeWindow CRD** — blackout and recurring allowed-hours windows; `changewindow["name"]` CEL function evaluates to `true` when the window is active/blocking
- **K-05: Bundle.status.metrics** — commitToFirstStageMinutes, commitToProductionMinutes, bakeResets, operatorInterventions; `kardinal metrics` CLI command
- **K-06: Wave topology** — `wave: N` field on environment spec; Wave N automatically depends on all Wave N-1 stages
- **K-07: Integration test step** — built-in `integration-test` step runs a Kubernetes Job as part of the promotion sequence
- **K-08: PR review gate** — `bundle.pr["staging"].isApproved` and `.approvalCount` in CEL context via PRStatus CRD
- **K-09: `kardinal override` with audit record** — emergency gate override with mandatory reason + time limit; override record in Bundle status and PR evidence body
- **K-10: Cross-stage history CEL** — `upstream.<env>.soakMinutes`, `.recentSuccessCount`, `.recentFailureCount`, `.lastPromotedAt` in gate expressions
- **UI control plane** — all 7 UI issues shipped (#462–#468): fleet health dashboard, pipeline ops view, per-stage bake countdown, in-UI actions (pause/resume/rollback/override), release metrics bar, bundle timeline, policy gate detail panel

### Fixed

- krocodile upgraded to `948ad6c` — DNS-1123 node ID validation, drift timers, propagation hash improvements
- `changewindow.isAllowed()` / `changewindow.isBlocked()` CEL helpers added alongside the map-style access

---


## [v0.4.0] — 2026-04-12

**Distributed Mode, Argo Rollouts delegation, graph purity, K-series features**

### Added

- **Distributed mode** — `--shard` flag routes PromotionSteps to matching shard agents; supports multi-cluster deployments where each spoke cluster runs its own agent
- **Argo Rollouts delivery delegation** — `delivery.delegate: argo-rollouts` in Pipeline env spec hands off rollout progression to an existing `Rollout` resource
- **GitLab + Forgejo/Gitea SCM providers** — `scm.provider: gitlab` and `scm.provider: forgejo` in Pipeline spec
- **PRStatus CRD** — makes PR merge/close signal observable by the Graph (eliminates 6 GitHub API call paths from the reconciler hot path)
- **RollbackPolicy CRD** — auto-rollback threshold comparison moved to dedicated reconciler
- **Graph purity milestone** — all 41 krocodile-independent logic leaks eliminated (see `docs/design/11-graph-purity-tech-debt.md`)
- **K-01: Contiguous bake timer** — `bake.minutes` + `bake.policy: reset-on-alarm` on environment spec; `BakeElapsedMinutes` and `BakeResets` in PromotionStep status
- **K-02: Pre-deploy gates** — `when: pre-deploy` on PolicyGate spec; blocks before `git-clone` starts
- **K-03: onHealthFailure policy** — `rollback | abort | none` per environment; rollback auto-creates a new Bundle at the previous image version
- **K-04: ChangeWindow CRD** — blackout and recurring allowed-hours windows; CEL context `changewindow["name"]`
- **K-05: Bundle.status.metrics** — commitToFirstStageMinutes, commitToProductionMinutes, bakeResets, operatorInterventions
- **K-06: Wave topology** — `wave: N` field on environment spec; Wave N automatically depends on all Wave N-1 stages
- **K-07: Integration test step** — built-in `integration-test` step runs a Kubernetes Job inline during promotion
- **K-08: PR review gate** — `bundle.pr["staging"].isApproved` and `.approvalCount` CEL attributes via PRStatus CRD
- **K-09: kardinal override** — emergency gate override with mandatory reason; override record in PR evidence body
- **K-10: Subscription CRD** — reconciler scaffolded; source watchers (OCI, Git) are stubs pending #491/#493
- **K-11: Cross-stage history CEL** — `upstream.staging.soakMinutes`, `.recentSuccessCount`, `.recentFailureCount`, `.lastPromotedAt` in CEL context

### Fixed

- Pause enforcement via `bundle.status.paused` (eliminates in-memory pause state)
- Step cleanup on pipeline deletion no longer leaves orphaned PromotionSteps
- PolicyGate re-evaluation after TTL now fires correctly when graph resumes

---

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-04-12

**Observability: embedded UI, PR evidence, GitHub Actions**

### Added

- **Embedded React UI** — promotion DAG visualization with 6-state health chips, CEL expression display, live polling with staleness indicator, blocked-gate banner
- **PR evidence body** — structured markdown in every prod PR: image digest, CI run link, gate results, upstream soak time
- **kardinal diff** — `kardinal diff <bundle-a> <bundle-b>` shows artifact delta
- **kardinal approve** — approve a Bundle bypassing upstream gate requirements
- **kardinal metrics** — DORA-style promotion metrics (deployment frequency, lead time, fail rate)
- **kardinal refresh / dashboard / logs** — operational CLI commands
- **History command** — `kardinal history <pipeline>` shows previous promotions

### Fixed

- DAG graph deduplicates gate nodes (was showing duplicate PolicyGate cards)
- Pipeline phase uses `status.phase` not condition reason for display
- Explain command deduplicates gate output when multiple instances match

---

## [v0.2.1] — 2026-04-12

**Graph Purity: all krocodile-independent logic leaks eliminated**

### Added

- **PRStatus CRD** — replaces in-reconciler GitHub API polling for PR state
- **RollbackPolicy CRD** — moves auto-rollback threshold logic out of PromotionStepReconciler
- **ScheduleClock CRD** — writes `status.tick` on a configurable interval to drive time-based policy gate re-evaluation via real Kubernetes watch events; replaces the `ctrl.Result{RequeueAfter}` timer loop pattern

### Fixed

- `time.Now()` calls moved outside reconciler hot paths into CRD status writes
- Cross-CRD status mutations eliminated — each reconciler writes only to its own CRD
- `exec.Command()` in reconciler replaced with library call

---

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-04-11

**Workshop 1 Complete — first end-to-end validated release**

### Milestone

kardinal-promoter now executes the [AWS Platform Engineering on EKS workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/platform-engineering-on-eks/en-US/30-progressiveapplicationdelivery/40-production-deploy-kargo) end-to-end on a live kind cluster.

### Added

- **MetricCheck CRD** — Prometheus-backed policy gates: block promotions when error rate > threshold
- **Custom promotion steps** — HTTP webhook steps for extensible promotion workflows
- **Auto-rollback** — configurable failure threshold triggers rollback PR after N consecutive health failures
- **Pause/resume** — `kardinal pause/resume <pipeline>` halts in-flight promotions
- **Policy simulate** — `kardinal policy simulate` evaluates gates without creating a Bundle
- **Policy test** — `kardinal policy test` validates CEL syntax offline
- **Policy list** — lists active PolicyGates scoped to a pipeline/environment
- **Promote command** — `kardinal promote` creates a Bundle from the last verified image
- **Config Bundle type** — promotes Git commit SHAs through the same pipeline as image Bundles
- **Rendered manifests step** — `pre-render` strategy generates environment-specific YAML

### Fixed

- kind E2E infrastructure (`make setup-e2e-env`) sets up krocodile + ArgoCD + test/uat/prod namespaces
- `kardinal get pipelines` shows per-environment status columns
- `kardinal explain` shows active PolicyGates with CEL expression and current value
